- 👋 Hi, I’m @darksaber9999
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a web developer, and then eventually I want to work on games in some fashion or form. Whether that be a solo hobby type of thing or an actual career, I'm open to anything and everything!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML/CSS and JavaScript. I had a bit of exposure to Python, Java, and .NET in my schooling and have been trying to build up more of a portfolio to show off what I'm learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on learning, I guess. I'm at the point where it can sometimes feel like there is too much to learn and I'm not making progress towards the career change that I want, but I'm trying to keep focused on learning at least a little everyday.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
